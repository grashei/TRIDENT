## Getting Started:

### 🔨 1. **Installation**:
- Create a conda environment: `conda create -n "trident" python=3.10`, and activate it `conda activate trident`.
- **Install from local clone**:
    - `git clone https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident.git && cd trident`.
    - Local install with running `pip install -e .`.
- **Install with pip**:
    - `pip install git+https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident.git `
- Additional packages may be required if you are loading specific pretrained models. Follow error messages for additional instructions.

### 🔨 2. **Running Trident**:

**Feeling lucky?**

Want patch features, fast? Perform all processing steps (segmentation, patching, patch feature extraction using UNI) for a whole directory of WSIs in a single command:

```
python run_batch_of_slides.py --task all --wsi_dir wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --patch_encoder uni_v1 --mag 20 --patch_size 256
```

**Feeling cautious?**

Run this script to perform all processing steps for just a single slide:
```
python run_single_slide.py --slide_path wsis/xxxx.svs --job_dir ./trident_processed --patch_encoder uni_v1 --mag 20 --patch_size 256
```

**Or follow step-by-step instructions:**

**Step 1: Tissue Segmentation**
 - **Description**: Segments tissue vs. background regions from a list of WSIs in `wsi_dir`.
 - **Command**:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_of_slides.py --task seg --wsi_dir ./wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --gpu 0
   ```
   - `--task seg`: Specifies that you want to do tissue segmentation.
   - `--wsi_dir ./wsis`: Path to the directory containing WSIs.
   - `--job_dir ./trident_processed`: Output directory for processed results.
   - `--gpu 0`: Uses GPU with index 0 for computation.
 - **Outputs**:
   - WSI thumbnails are saved in `./trident_processed/thumbnails`.
   - WSI thumbnails annotated with tissue contours are saved in `./trident_processed/contours`.
   - GeoJSON files containing tissue contours are saved in `./trident_processed/contours_geojson`. These can be opened in [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) for editing/quality control, if necessary.

 **Step 2: Tissue Patching**
 - **Description**: Extracts patches from segmented tissue regions at a specific magnification.
 - **Command**:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_of_slides.py --task coords --wsi_dir wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --mag 20 --patch_size 256 --overlap 0
   ```
   - `--task coords`: Specifies that you want to do patching.
   - `--wsi_dir wsis`: Path to the directory containing WSIs.
   - `--job_dir ./trident_processed`: Output directory for processed results.
   - `--mag 20`: Extracts patches at 20x magnification.
   - `--patch_size 256`: Each patch is 256x256 pixels.
   - `--overlap 0`: Patches overlap by 0 pixels. Note that this is the absolute overlap in pixels, i.e. use `--overlap 128` for 50% overlap on patches of size 256.
 - **Outputs**:
   - Patch coordinates are saved as h5 files in `./trident_processed/20x_256px/patches`.
   - WSI thumbnails annotated with patch borders are saved in `./trident_processed/20x_256px/visualization`.

 **Step 3a: Patch Feature Extraction**
 - **Description**: Extracts features from tissue patches using a specified encoder.
 - **Command**:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_of_slides.py --task feat --wsi_dir wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed --patch_encoder uni_v1 --mag 20 --patch_size 256 
   ```
   - `--task feat`: Specifies that you want to do feature extraction.
   - `--wsi_dir wsis`: Path to the directory containing WSIs.
   - `--job_dir ./trident_processed`: Output directory for processed results.
   - `--patch_encoder uni_v1`: Uses the `UNIv1` patch encoder. Could also be `conch_v1`, `ctranspath`, `gigapath`, `virchow`, `hoptimus0`, etc. See below for list of supported models. 
   - `--mag 20`: Features are extracted from patches at 20x magnification.
   - `--patch_size 256`: Patches are 256x256 pixels in size.
 - **Outputs**: 
   - Features are saved as h5 files in `./trident_processed/20x_256px/features_uni_v1`. (Shape: `(n_patches, feature_dim)`)

Trident supports 13 patch encoders, loaded via a patch-level [`encoder_factory`](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident/blob/main/trident/patch_encoder_models/load.py#L14). Models requiring specific installations will return error messages with additional instructions. Gated models on HuggingFace require access requests.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a patient containing multiple slides, you have two ways for constructing whole-patient embeddings: processing each slide independently and taking the average of the slide features (late fusion) or pooling all patches together and processing that as a single "pseudo-slide" (early fusion). You can use Trident-generated slide embeddings in your own late fusion pipeline, or use Trident-generated patch embeddings in your own early fusion pipeline. For an implementation of both fusion strategies, please check out our sister repository [Patho-Bench](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/Patho-Bench).

Please see our [tutorials](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident/tree/main/tutorials) for more cool things you can do with Trident and a more [detailed readme](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident/blob/main/DETAILS.md) for additional features.

## Quality Control

trident outputs a variety of files for quality control. It is recommended that you review these files after each step to ensure that the results are as expected.

1. Segmentation contours are saved in the `./<job_dir>/contours` directory. These are thumbnails of the WSI with the tissue contours drawn in green.

<img src="_readme/contours.jpg" alt="WSI thumbnail with the tissue contours drawn in green." height="150px">

2. Patch annotations are saved in the `./<job_dir>/<patch_dir>/visualization` directory. These are thumbnails of the WSI with the patch borders drawn in red.

## 🙋 FAQ
- **Q**: How do I extract patch embeddings from legacy patch coordinates extracted with [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM)?
   - **A**:
      ```bash
      python run_batch_of_slides.py --task feat --wsi_dir ..wsis --job_dir legacy_dir --patch_encoder uni_v1 --mag 20 --patch_size 256 --coords_dir extracted_mag20x_patch256_fp/
      ```
- **Q**: How do I keep patches corresponding to holes in the tissue?
   - **A**: In `run_batch_of_slides`, this behavior is default. Set `--remove_holes` to exclude patches on top of holes.

- **Q**: I see weird messages when building models using timm. What is happening?
   - **A**: Make sure `timm==0.9.16` is installed. `timm==1.X.X` creates issues with most models. 

- **Q**: How can I use `run_single_slide.py` and `run_batch_of_slides.py` in other repos with minimal work?
  - **A**: Make sure `trident` is installed using `pip install -e .`. Then, both scripts are exposed and can be integrated into any Python code, e.g., as

```python
import sys 
from run_single_slide import main

sys.argv = [
    "run_single_slide",
    '--slide_path', "output/wsis/394140.svs",
    "--job_dir", 'output/',
    "--mag", "20",
    "--patch_size", '256'
]

main()
```

- **Q**: I am not satisfied with the tissue vs background segmentation. What can I do?
   - **A**: Trident uses GeoJSON to store and load segmentations. This format is natively supported by [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/). You can load the Trident segmentation into QuPath, modify it using QuPath's annotation tools, and save the updated segmentation back to GeoJSON.
   - **A**: You can try rerunning the segmentation step at a higher magnification (which may be slower, but more accurate).
   - **A**: You can finetune the Trident segmentation model on a few annotated examples to improve performance for your specific use case.

- **Q**: I want to process a custom list of WSIs. Can I do it? Also, most of my WSIs don't have the micron per pixel (mpp) stored. Can I pass it?
   - **A**: Yes using the `--custom_list_of_wsis` argument. Provide a list of WSI names in a CSV (with slide extension, `wsi`). Optionally, provide the mpp (field `mpp`)
 
 - **Q**: Do I need to install any additional packages to use Trident?
   - **A**: Most pretrained models require additional dependencies (e.g., the CTransPath patch encoder requires `pip install timm_ctp`). When you load a model using Trident, it will tell you what dependencies are missing and how to install them.
